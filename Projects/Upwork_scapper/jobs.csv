Seeking consultant to tell us how to use AI to help write branded emails for our clients (1 hour),Posted 1 hour ago,Fixed price,Intermediate,N/A,"Hello!

We are a medium-sized paid ads and email marketing agency.

We are looking to streamline our email copy-writing (especially for our automated flows).

Currently, we have templated copy structures for all of our automated emails for every client we take on. We manually use theses structures and some example text to write new copy for each new client... applying their brand voice and product features and benefits, etc.

Although we have streamlined the copy-writing process greatly, we know that with AI technology it is probably possible to more quickly write the copy for new clients because we already know the structure to follow (following our strategy and examples) and the brand voice of the client.

What we do not know is what tool or process we should look into. Does a tool already exist for this? Or is it worth developing our own mini-tool?

Our goal, in a nutshell, is to provide an AI tool with these main inputs:

1. The structure/strategy of each email we need to make (headline, subheadline, body text, CTA, etc. etc. - it is different based on the email)
2. Possibly example emails for reference.
3. The brand voice of the client (which we can just scrape from their website)
4. The core features-benefits, solutions, etc. etc. of their product and company.

And the idea would then be to receive the output:

1. For each email, we receive the copy that synthesizes all of the above. (and then we would quality control it and adjust it as-needed).

---

Basically, we made the copy-writing easy for ourselves using our templated structure and examples... but it is still tedious and energy-consuming.

---

But instead of scouring the internet for a possible solution... we'd love to just chat with an expert in the field of AI (and/or email copy-wriitng) to help point us in the right direction faster! Please write ""I am the copy-writing AI consultant you're looking for"" as the first line of your application to let us know you've read the entire job post.

If this interests you, please apply! 

Cheers,
Jake

p.s. I have attached a screenshot of our ""scaffolding"" spreadsheet where we manually generate email copy based on a set structure and a generic example. (column A is the ""section/goal"", column C is the ""generic copy example"" to give us a base of knowledge, and column B is where we write the branded copy for that specific client)
