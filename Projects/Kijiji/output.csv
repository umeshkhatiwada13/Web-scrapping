You will be sharing the 2 bedroom condo with me. I occupy the other room. I am a Software developer from Maharashtra, India and I have a hybrid work schedule.
The condo is equipped with high speed wifi (1.5 Gbps) and an in suite washer and dryer, and there's an underground parking that can be obtained with extra charges. It is managed by Target Parking.
It is in an incredibly convenient and accessible location with an amazing view. The condominium building is new, built in 2019 and has great amenities such as a gym, games room, movie theatre, outdoor grill station, a party hall and 24-hour security. FreshCo, Tim Hortons and more such stores are located on the ground floor of the building. Public transport is also very accessible from here with a bus stop right in front of the building and TTC subway station is 5 min walk.
The private bedroom is spacious, has a big window with a great view, a closet and the bathroom attached to it (bathroom has two separate entrances). The room is UNFURNISHED. The common areas and the kitchen are well furnished, and the view from the balcony is one to die for(I'm attaching some pictures I took, and you can also see the CN tower from here), and the balcony is great for two people to enjoy your morning or evening coffee.

Basement Room for Rent Kipling and Lakeshore,,"Etobicoke, ON M8V 3G7","March 10, 2024 4:45 PM",,,,"I am taking the initiative to help my landlord find a new roomate in the basement of a house near Kipling and Lakeshore.
I speak English and some French, the other tennant speaks Spanish and very little English. I have a preference for someone that is employed and can speak both English and Spanish to help the place run smoothly.
Otherwise you should be able to speak some English to communicate with me and the landlord who speaks English and Mandarin.
The landlord needs someone employed full time and with a credit score above 700. For someone who has just immigrated and not landed a job, a large enough bank balance will do....however that amount wasn't specified.
Each roomate has their own agreement with the landlord so you are only responsible for your own rent.
Street parking only for now and you will need a permit to park between 12-6am. It is easier if you don't have a vehicle.
